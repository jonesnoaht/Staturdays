## Intro to Random

Do some coin flips.

```{r}
pdf('plot.pdf', 200, 200)
x.df <- c()
y.df <- c()
for ( i in 1:1000 ) {
  x <- round(runif(1000, min = 0, max = 1))
  y <- runif(100, min = 0, max = 1)
  x.df <- c(x.df, sum(x))
  y.df <- c(y.df, y)
}
hist(x.df, breaks = 20)
hist(y.df, breaks = 20)
qqnorm(x.df)
qqnorm(y.df)
```


Look at some combinations and permutations

## Distributions

 - [ ] Look at binomial distribution

 - [x] Look at generating normal distribution

 - [ ] Sampling distribution and central limit theorem

## Percentiles

SD

Z-scores
